TODO:
  - figure out how to automatically add dates to the frontmatter of each posts
    - each filename is YYYYMMDD
    - in each file, the main part of the filename becomes part of the string `date: ${YYYY-MM-DD` 
    - that string is appended top the file as a line, right above the second instance of '---' which is the bottom of the frontmatter

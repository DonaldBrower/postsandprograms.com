description: Answers to all the problems from hard parts v2... Learn how this whole Javascript thing works. Questions go over programming with higher order functions, the callback and microtask queues and the event loop. The rules of static scoping and thinking about which lines of code have access to which variable environments. A lot of depth to these hard parts workshops.

## Tuesday morning.

This is something cool that I'd like to impliment myself.

On frontendmasters.com and asana.com, when the video is finished (and on FEM, when it's the last in a course), the video player becomes a custom message with buttons and everything. That isn't something you get for free on embedded video players, I don't think.

they also used vimeo, and their end screen is different

The Asana website has some nice things. On the index page, I like the transitions between illustrations, the timeline demo (especially the lines pointing from one box to another). The use of type feels nice.

The process management section includes all the main colors as accents that get rotated into view. Animations make the rotation easier to look at.

Practice Problems
  - The number of atoms
  - BST traversal
  - Card games
  - Queries on a number of points inside a circle

Deep JS Foundations
  - Coercion and validation
  - Object.is polyfill
  - findAll() function that matches special coercive rules 

  - Function definition and expression vs arrow function comparisons
  - Refactor so function definitions are hoisted
  - Refactor to the module pattern

date: 2021-07-15
description: This is one of those CSS background pattern tools that is on the front page when you google. You might experience weirdness when you copy over the CSS verbaitum, depeding on what you're after. If you find the pattern is bleeding into child elements that you wish to remain above the element you've applied your "magic" background to, then here is the way to fix it.

## {{ title }}

There's a tool called [Magic Pattern](https://www.magicpattern.design/tools/css-backgrounds) which generates background patterns in CSS. When using the generated rules on an element, the background styles bleed into the child elements' backgrounds.

![Screen shot of the webpage. there is a single column of content, 800px wide with lots of space on the margins. there is a background pattern applied to the body element, and it should only fill up the extra space, but because of the bug we are about to explain, it also fills up the backgrounds of the body's child elements.](/images/background-bug-1.png)

``` css
body {
  background-color: #e5e5f7;
  opacity: 0.4;
  background-image: radial-gradient(#444cf7 2px, #e5e5f7 2px);
  background-size: 40px 40px;
}
```

Fix this by removing the opacity rule, and replacing the radial-gradient hex color arguments with rgba values and the _a_ value equal to the original opacity rule

``` css
body {
  background-color: #e5e5f7;
  background-image: radial-gradient(
    rgba(68, 76, 247, .4) 2px,
    rgba(229, 229, 247, .4) 2px
  );
  background-size: 40px 40px;
}
```

![The same webpage pictured above, but with the css fix applied, so it appears that the child elements ar  resting atop the body's background, with their own backgrounds](/images/background-bug-2.png)

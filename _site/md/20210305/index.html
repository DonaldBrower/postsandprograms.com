<h1>Secret Heist to steal the declaration of independence</h1>
<p>Message: March 5th, 2021:</p>
<p>Dear heist members. The heist will commence on August 25th. The only way it will not happen is if somebody foils it. They'd go to http://foiledmachine.com and they'd type, 'YOU BEEN FOILED's `</p>
<pre><code>I, THE LEADER OF THE HEIST, DECLARE THIS HEIST CANCELLED.

<p>into a text box somewhere</p>

<h2>Thinking about what to work on next</h2>
<p>From one big scoop through my journals and computer files, here is the big list of projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>postsandprograms.com</li>
<li>donny-b.com</li>
<li>browerwoodturning.com</li>
<li>the number of atoms</li>
<li>save the decalration</li>
<li>library of examples</li>
<li>eenie meenie minie moe</li>
<li>highcharts tricks</li>
<li>mmtech clone</li>
<li>tab32 import clone</li>
<li>bash deploy tools</li>
<li>carnegie hall</li>
<li>goal garden</li>
<li>speaker c</li>
<li>rpi full fidelity streamer</li>
<li>voice assisted dictionary</li>
<li>wicit refactor</li>
</ul>
<p>Theses have been worked on to different degrees. I haven't touched the wicit refactor, but I've spent hours coding layouts for those first couple websites, and my library of examples is growing by the day. It occurs to me there is some hanging fruit here. Quick ways of making some of this work more presentable.</p>
<p>I'm going to start at this list intently for several minutes, as long as it takes in order to find some path forward that I feel really good about.</p>
<h3>postsandprograms.com</h3>
<p>My convert script doesn't do enough. It's got to work with templates, too. I think it would be easiest to migrate to eleventy.</p>
<p>Every post that is simply pasted code gets moved to the library of examples. Only code posts that are completely explained can be called 'posts'.</p>
<p>There's an eleventy project next to this one. Time to migrate.</p>
<p>I can probably just move the md files wholesale. Yup. I can. Time to start editing in the other project. Here is the split. Goodbye, convertScript?</p>
<p>Okay! Here I am. Editing in the eleventy project. I'm gonna try to make my post layout into a thing.</p>

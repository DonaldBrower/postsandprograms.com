<p>From one big scoop through my journals and computer files, here is the big list of projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>postsandprograms.com</li>
<li>donny-b.com</li>
<li>browerwoodturning.com</li>
<li>the number of atoms</li>
<li>save the decalration</li>
<li>library of examples</li>
<li>eenie meenie minie moe</li>
<li>highcharts tricks</li>
<li>mmtech clone</li>
<li>tab32 import clone</li>
<li>bash deploy tools</li>
<li>carnegie hall</li>
<li>goal garden</li>
<li>speaker c</li>
<li>rpi full fidelity streamer</li>
<li>voice assisted dictionary</li>
<li>wicit refactor</li>
</ul>
<p>Theses have been worked on to different degrees. I haven't touched the wicit refactor, but I've spent hours coding layouts for those first couple websites, and my library of examples is growing by the day. It occurs to me there is some hanging fruit here. Quick ways of making some of this work more presentable.</p>
<p>I'm going to start at this list intently for several minutes, as long as it takes in order to find some path forward that I feel really good about.</p>
<h3>postsandprograms.com</h3>
<p>Started converting that homespun site into an eleventy site. It's working well, and it's nice to not worry about how all the building and serving stuff works.</p>
